This program reads events from a linux joystick device and displays
them in a human readable format.

The A and B menu options are generic and can be used with any joystick.

The C option is meant to be used with a raphnet.net wusbmote[1] adapter
and an extenmote adapter[2]. If a different wii accessory to USB adapter
is used, the button labels probably won't match.

Here is an example setup I used it for QA when implementing mapping 
changes:

N64 controller -> extenmote -> wusbmote -> PC running maptest.
